This tutorial is walks you through the React learning [trail](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) trail, hence keep the [trail](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) trail open in one tab of browser. You can change the code and see it's effect in the browser immediately. 

**PS-**
This project helps you only to learn about React, in your machine rather than in CodePen. The [trail](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) trail suggests to use [CodePen](https://codepen.io/ericnakagawa/pen/vXpjwZ?editors=0010) CodePen. But I felt doing it in my machine I was able to do lot more tweaking.
