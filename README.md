**PS-**
This project helps you learn React by doing it in your machine instead of doing it in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/ericnakagawa/pen/vXpjwZ?editors=0010) as the [trail](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) suggests. 
This project uses babel and webpack for code compilation and build purposes, you can safely ignore these two for now and once you have good grip on React you can then move on to learn about these technologies (and many more in React's ecosystem).
