# tic-tac-toe
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game, following react tutorial [trail](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) 

**Steps**

1. Clone this repository (`git clone git@github.com:muqsith/tic-tac-toe.git`) 

2. `$ npm install`

3. Open folder in Atom or Sublime editor.

4. `$ npm start`

5. Go to browser open url `http://localhost:8888`.

6. Play game!

7. Look only in the src folder for React code. And make changes only in the files in src folder for learning purpose. Ignore all other files, they are there only for building code, running the code and other minor tasks.

**PS-**
This project helps you learn React by doing it in your machine instead of doing it in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/ericnakagawa/pen/vXpjwZ?editors=0010) as the [trail](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) suggests. 
This project uses babel and webpack for code compilation and build purposes, you can safely ignore these two for now and once you have good grip on React you can then move on to learn about these technologies (and many more in React's ecosystem).
